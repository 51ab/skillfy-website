# skillfy-website
skillfy website is one of my web development project where i have used html and css and javacsript .

I made a drop down menu where you can search for any online course including java,python,c , web designing ,web development,android using kotlin.

You can also order books of various types including fiction,horrible,comic,related to your course.

You can give rating , check , check pricing , check reviews, and contact us as well.

I have made a animated search form using BOOTSTRAP and used hover effects to enhance my knowledge and try to make it more attractive.

It is just a begginer project so i have to work and addmay new things.

HOPE YOU LIKE IT :) 
THANKS :)
